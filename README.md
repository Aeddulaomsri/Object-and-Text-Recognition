**Shop Sign Detection and Text Recognition in Video**
This repository contains Python code for detecting shop signs and logos in video footage, followed by text recognition using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

**Functionality**
Object Detection: The code utilizes a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to identify shop signs and logos within video frames.
Text Recognition: Extracted shop sign regions are processed using Tesseract OCR to recognize the shop names.
Data Compilation: Recognized shop names and corresponding timestamps are compiled into an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
OpenCV
PyTorch
Tesseract-OCR (with appropriate language packs if needed)
pandas
Pillow (PIL Fork)
